# error-correction-comparison
Signal Resilience Simulator – Built a Python-based communication system simulator modeling noise interference and comparing Hamming vs Reed–Solomon error correction. Measured Bit Error Rate (BER) under varying SNR levels to evaluate reliability trade-offs in wireless transmission systems.
